<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/Headshot.JPG" width="200"/>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Parisa Rohanianâ€”a passionate content creator, dedicated archer, and aspiring computer scientist based in San Francisco.</p>

<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Archer & Athlete</h2>
<p>With six World Cup medals and four California State gold medals under my belt, archery has taught me discipline, precision, and resilience. I was the captain of my national archery team, leading my teammates to international victories. Even after a short break, my love for the sport remains strong, and Iâ€™m excited to get back into it!</p>

<h2>ðŸ“± Content Creator & Digital Storyteller</h2>
<p>I create engaging lifestyle, productivity, and wellness content for an audience of 100K+ followers on Instagram. My focus? Helping women in their 20s and 30s navigate life with confidenceâ€”whether itâ€™s through skincare, morning routines, or personal growth challenges. Iâ€™ve collaborated with brands like Biossance, La Roche-Posay, Murad, and Shark, sharing honest and insightful reviews with my community.</p>

<h2>ðŸ’» Computer Science & Innovation</h2>
<p>As an Iranian computer science student in the U.S., Iâ€™m deeply interested in technology and innovation in healthcare. My journey in coding started with personal projects, and I now work as a STEM tutor and a computer science tutor after being invited by my professor. I love building applications that merge tech with problem-solving, like my calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m also currently exploring React development for my next project!</p>

<h2>ðŸŽ¯ What Drives Me?</h2>
<p>I believe in continuous learning, creativity, and pushing boundariesâ€”whether itâ€™s in sports, tech, or content creation. I love sharing my journey, inspiring others, and collaborating on exciting projects.</p>
